          <h3>Conservation Areas: Celebrating 50 years</h3>
          <p>
            Conservation Areas were established 50 years ago in 1967 by the
            Civic Amenities Act and the Bloomsbury Conservation Area Advisory
            Committee (BCAAC), held an event to celebrate their important
            contribution to the preservation and enhancement of our built
            environment. Hosted by Hugh Cullum Architects, the Conservation
            Advisory Committee was addressed by Frank Dobson, the long-serving
            MP for Holborn and St Pancras (1979 to 2015). Frank Dobson has lived
            in Bloomsbury for many years and has supported BCAAC throughout by
            actively championing the cause of conservation in the local area.
            The Bloomsbury Conservation Area is large: approximately 160
            hectares and is bounded by Euston Road to the north and High Holborn
            and Lincolnâ€™s Inn Fields to the south and from Tottenham Court Road
            in the west......
